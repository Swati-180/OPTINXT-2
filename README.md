## Overview

QG Tools - BPER Platform is an internal workflow intelligence system designed to:

- Collect detailed employee process/effort inputs through structured submissions.
- Map captured data into a central process taxonomy.
- Support manager review and governance of submitted records.
- Deliver analytics views such as WDT, 6x6 analysis, utilization, FTE, fitment, and consolidation.

The application is split into two portals backed by a shared API:

- Employee portal for submission and status tracking.
- Manager portal for administration, review, taxonomy operations, analytics, and audit visibility.

## Core Capabilities

- Secure JWT-based authentication and role-based route access.
- Employee form submission lifecycle (create, submit, review feedback loop, resubmit).
- Dynamic process/taxonomy-backed activity selection.
- Manager user management and bulk actions.
- Reporting and analytics endpoints for operational decision support.
- Audit logging for critical actions and governance traceability.

## User Roles and Flows

### Employee

- Logs in through employee-specific authentication.
- Completes and submits BPER entries.
- Tracks submission status and review outcomes.

### Manager/Admin

- Logs in through manager authentication and selects manager portal.
- Reviews submissions and user records.
- Monitors dashboards and deep analysis modules.
- Manages taxonomy/process dimensions and audit logs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- MongoDB instance (local or hosted)

### 1) Install dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install

cd ../server
npm install
```

### 2) Configure backend environment

Create a `.env` file in `server/`:

```env
MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
JWT_SECRET=<your_strong_jwt_secret>
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
GMAIL_USER=<your_gmail@gmail.com>
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=<your_gmail_app_password>
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### 3) Configure frontend environment

Create a `.env` file in `client/`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 4) Run backend

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### 5) Run frontend

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Frontend default URL: `http://localhost:3000`

## Environment Variables

### Server (`server/.env`)

- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection URI.
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key used to sign JWT tokens.
- `PORT`: API port (default: `5000`).
- `NODE_ENV`: Runtime mode.
- `GMAIL_USER`: Gmail address used to send platform emails (WDT notifications, employee invites).
- `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`: Gmail App Password for SMTP (requires 2-Step Verification on the Google account).
- `FRONTEND_URL`: Public frontend URL used in email links (default: `http://localhost:3001`).

### Client (`client/.env`)

- `VITE_API_URL`: Backend base URL.

## Seed Data and Demo Accounts

To seed local development data:

```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

Quick sign-in credentials:

1. Name: QG Admin  
   Email: admin@BPER.com  
   Password: Admin@123  
   Role: admin (manager portal access)

2. Name: QG Employee  
   Email: employee@bper.com  
   Password: Employee@123  
   Role: employee

Use seeded accounts only for local development/testing.

## API Surface (High Level)

Primary backend route groups:

- `/api/auth` - signup, login, profile, and user administration.
- `/api/wdt` - submission and review workflows.
- `/api/reports` - dashboard and analytics reports.
- `/api/analysis` - analysis framework outputs.
- `/api/taxonomy` - taxonomy/process mapping operations.
- `/api/activities` - activity/tower/process list and custom entries.
- `/api/fitment` - fitment profile operations.

## Deployment

Recommended split deployment:

- Frontend: Vercel (root: `client`) or Azure Static Web Apps (see `.github/workflows/deploy-azure.yml`)
- Backend: Render (root: `server`) or Azure Container Apps (Dockerfile: `server/Dockerfile`)

Set production environment variables securely in hosting platforms.
Do not commit credentials or secrets to source control.

### Production environment variables

**Backend** (Render / Azure Container Apps):

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MONGODB_URI` | Yes | MongoDB connection |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | JWT signing |
| `NODE_ENV` | Yes | Set to `production` |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Yes | Deployed frontend URL (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`) |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Yes | Same frontend URL — used in email links |
| `GMAIL_USER` | For email | Gmail sender address |
| `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | For email | Gmail App Password |

**Frontend** (Vercel / Azure Static Web Apps):

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_API_URL` | Yes | Deployed backend URL (e.g. `https://your-api.onrender.com`) |

See `deployment_guide.md` for full Azure and Vercel/Render setup steps.

## Known Notes

- The backend can attempt an in-memory MongoDB fallback if primary DB connection fails, but production should always use a managed MongoDB URI.
- If changing API base URL behavior, ensure frontend API utilities and environment config remain consistent; some legacy calls may still need manual alignment.
