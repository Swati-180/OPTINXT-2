## Technical Audit: Algorithms & Data Integrity

### 1. Algorithm Overview
| Framework | Logic / Algorithm | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WDT (Work Distribution)** | PRD Logic: `Hours = (Vol * Min) / 60`, `FTE = Hrs/160`, `Util = Total/160` | **Active** |
| **6x6 Matrix Scoring** | PRD Logic: Binary scoring (H in Group1, L in Group2). Threshold >= 7. | **Active** |
| **Submission Window** | Date-range validation: Enforces `20th <= day <= 31st`. | **Active** |
| **NLP Mapping** | Semantic matching using taxonomy vector search. | **In Progress** |
